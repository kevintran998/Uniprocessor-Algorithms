# Uniprocessor-Algorithms

***** DESCRIPTION *****
This program compares First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR),
Shortest Process Next (SPN), and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) algorithm
and determining which algorithm is the most efficient based on turnaround
time and relative turn around time.

***** PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS *****
- Generates random test data for 1000 different simulations with 20 processes
(5 per algorithm) for each simulation
- No user input is required
- Outputs a chart displaying Turnaround Time and Relative Turnaround Time
for each of the four algorithms

***** PROGRAMING LANGUAGE AND TOOLS *****
- Written in C++
- Xcode

***** WHAT I LEARNED *****
I learned how the four algorithms process data and which one would be the 
most efficient to implement in a uniprocessor system.
